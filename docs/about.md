# About

## General Documentation
This site was made when I discovered the power of markdown and how well-organized it can be if configured and setup correctly.

Utilizing a framework called MkDocs, this GitHub pages site will be the home for random documentation that I find will be helpful to have

## One Central Location
I was mainly tired of having my documentation and general notes spread all-around on my pc and wanted to make things more organized.

This also can serve a purpose to show off my knowledge while practicing markdown and general documentation practices

I will most likely have this up on my main website as well at [Nick's Cool Stuff](https://nickscoolstuff.com) (Shameless Plug)

## Final Thoughts
This about page is more of a synopsis. The home page will have more links and whatnot in case you want to copy this page's setup.

Things are bound to change over time, so if you want to see the progress of this page, feel free to come back again!

Thanks
