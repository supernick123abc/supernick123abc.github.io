Utilizing a framework called MkDocs, this GitHub pages site will be the home for random documentation that I find will be helpful to have One Central Location I was mainly tired of having my documentation and general notes spread all-around on my pc and wanted to make things more organized. This also can serve a purpose to show off my knowledge while practicing markdown and general documentation practices I will most likely have this up on my main website as well at Nick's Cool Stuff (Shameless Plug) Final Thoughts This about page is more of a synopsis. The home page will have more links and whatnot in case you want to copy this page's setup.
